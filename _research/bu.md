## Description

The work presented here was done as part of a summer internship at the [Boston University Photonics Center](https://www.bu.edu/photonics/) under the direction of [Dr. Ji-Xin Cheng](https://sites.bu.edu/cheng-group/the-pi/). This project was mentored by [Yi Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yi-Zhang-655), with a write-up available [here](/files/bu_research.pdf) and presentation slides [here](/files/bu_presentation.pdf).

## Abstract

Deep brain diseases therapy holds promise for a growing number of neurologic disorders, but suffers from a lack of effective drug delivery approach for blood brain barrier penetration. There is a clear need for a method of ultrasound generation in the deep brain. We address this unmet need via development of fiber-based photoacoustic technology for the nasal pathway, which enables localized ultrasound generation in the deep brain. We have demonstrated that the frequency of photoacoustics (PA) can be modulated via the geometry of fiber coating, which is the key to ultimately realize desirable frequency generation. Now we want to clearly illustrate the relationship between the PA geometry and the ultrasound it generates.
