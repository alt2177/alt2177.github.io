## Description 

This paper presents a summary of the research I did under the supervision of Dr. Kui Ren. Specifically, it is an investigation into Optimal Transport Theory that is motivated from first principles to eventually lead to the definition of the Wasserstein Distance. The calculation of the $W_1$ distance is formulated as an optimization problem using the Kantorovich-Rubinstein Duality Theorem, and several applications are presented.
