## Project Description

CrowdCount is a brand-new project created for the 2020 COVID Hackathon II hosted by the Stevens Venture Center. This site utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision to track the number of people entering and exiting an establishment and updates a database in real-time, allowing business owners to get a live feed of how busy their location is. Not only would this enable earlier re-opening for businesses, but it would also create an environment that is safe for owners, workers, and patrons alike. Additionally, CrowdCount offers an easy-to-use, search-based website that allows members of the public to see both real-time and daily average data for crowd sizes at establishments of their choice.
