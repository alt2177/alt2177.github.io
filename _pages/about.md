Hello and welcome to my page! I'm Austin and I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) studying Applied Mathematics and CS. I've worked as a data scientist, data analyst, teaching assistant, and as a student researcher. My primary research interests are in statistical inference (more specifically variational techniques), mathematical foundations of machine learning, and data analytics. 

During my time at Columbia, I've had the opportunity to work on various research endeavours and personal projects. I'm advised by [Prof. Kui Ren](https://www.apam.columbia.edu/faculty/kui-ren) and have worked closely with the faculty in the [APAM Department](https://www.apam.columbia.edu/). Professionally, I was most recently a Jr. Associate Data Analyst at [Panzura](https://panzura.com/). Additionally, I served as the Vice President of the [Columbia University Robotics Club](https://www.columbiaroboticsclub.com/) from 2020-21 and was previously on the Software Team.

I am also deeply involved in music at Columbia, where I am a clarinetist in the [Columbia University Orchestra](https://cuo.music.columbia.edu/) and the [Columbia Bach Society](https://columbiabachsociety.weebly.com/). Sports-wise, I was a member of club tennis and have been involved in the sport for over a decade, both as a player and a coach. Though I never achieved the D1 dream, I will always love and appreciate the sport (yes I am a washed-up athlete :-)
