Hello and welcome to my page! I'm Austin and I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate at Columbia University studying Applied Mathematics and CS. I've worked as a data scientist, data analyst, teaching assistant, and as a student researcher. My primary research interests are in statistical inference (more specifically variational techniques), mathematical foundations of machine learning, and data analytics.
