Thank you for taking the time to check out my music page! As mentioned in my bio, I am a clarinetist in the Columbia University Orchestra (CUO) and Columbia University Bach Society. I have been fortunate enough to work closely with Maestro [Jeffrey Milarsky](https://cuo.music.columbia.edu/jeffrey-milarsky) as both an orchestral musician and an aspiring conductor. 

As part of CUO, I've gotten to rehearse and perform with top-tier musicians not only from Columbia, but also from [The Juilliard School](https://www.juilliard.edu/) and from [The Manhattan School of Music](https://www.msmnyc.edu/). Together, we have performed at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall, as well as The Symphony Space in Manhattan. Earlier on in my undergraduate career, I was a part of the [Columbia University Wind Ensemble](https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/student-group/wind-ensemble).

Prior to entering college, I was the clarinet Section Leader in the [Fremont High School Wind Ensemble](https://www.fremontinstrumentalmusic.org/groups/wind-ensemble) and also played principal clarinet whenever we had a full symphony orchestra. I also had the opportunity to play in chamber groups, pit orchestras, and as a soloist during my time at FHS. I also performed in a number of honor ensembles, including the California All-State Honor Concert Band [(CASMEC)](https://calmusiced.com/).

Throughout my musical career, I studied under [Lisa Evans](https://themusicschool.org/faculty/#lisaevans).
